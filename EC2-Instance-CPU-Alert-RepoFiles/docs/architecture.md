## Notes & extensions
- Default CPU metric (AWS/EC2 CPUUtilization) is available without the CloudWatch Agent.
- For memory/disk metrics, install & configure the CloudWatch Agent.
- Extensions:
  - Lambda subscribed to SNS for custom automation (auto-scale, remediation)
  - EventBridge rules for advanced routing
  - PagerDuty/SMS integrations for on-call notifications
